> Joint Shift Estimation using Stochastic Interventions
__Authors:__ [David McCoy](https://davidmccoy.org)

## What's `JointXshift`?


The `JointXshift` is a simple package that compares the expected outcome change under a joint stochastic shift intervention (the change in outcome compared to the observed outcome if all exposures were shifted by a fixed amount), to the additive expected outcome change, the additive impact of each exposure shifted individually. The idea is that if the joint shift is positively larger, this indicates synergistic relationships in the mixed exposure, if it is negative this indicates more antagonistic relationships exist. Of course, if there is no difference between the joint and additive this could indicate no interaction or interactions that are both synergistic and antagonistic and cancel each other out.

---

## Installation

*Note:* Because the `JointXshift` package (currently) depends on `sl3` that
allows ensemble machine learning to be used for nuisance parameter
estimation and `sl3` is not on CRAN the `JointXshift` package is not
available on CRAN and must be downloaded here.

There are many depedencies for `JointXshift` so it's easier to break up 
installation of the various packages to ensure proper installation. 

First install the basis estimators used in the data-adaptive
variable discovery of the exposure and covariate space: 

`JointXshift` uses the `sl3` package to build ensemble machine learners for each nuisance parameter. 

```{r sl3_devel,  eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("tlverse/sl3@devel")
```

Make sure `sl3` installs correctly then install `JointXshift`

```{r JointXshift_install,  eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("blind-contours/JointXshift@main")
```

---

## Example

To illustrate how `JointXshift` may be used to ascertain the effect of a mixed exposure, consider the following example:

```{r example, warning=FALSE}
library(JointXshift)
library(devtools)
library(kableExtra)
library(sl3)

seed <- 429153
set.seed(seed)
```

We will directly use synthetic data from the NIEHS used to test new mixture methods. This data has built in strong positive and negative marginal effects and certain interactions. Found here: https://github.com/niehs-prime/2015-NIEHS-MIxtures-Workshop

```{r NIEHS example}
data("NIEHS_data_1", package = "JointXshift")
```

```{r NIEH Nodes}
NIEHS_data_1$W <- rnorm(nrow(NIEHS_data_1), mean = 0, sd = 0.1)
w <- NIEHS_data_1[, c("W", "Z")]
a <- NIEHS_data_1[, c("X1", "X2", "X3", "X4", "X5", "X6", "X7")]
y <- NIEHS_data_1$Y

deltas <- list(
  "X1" = 1, "X2" = 1, "X3" = 1,
  "X4" = 1, "X5" = 1, "X6" = 1, "X7" = 1
)
head(NIEHS_data_1) %>%
  kbl(caption = "NIEHS Data") %>%
  kable_classic(full_width = F, html_font = "Cambria")
```


We will apply our method to see if there is largely more synergistic or antagonistic relationships in the data. 

```{r run JointXshift, eval = TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

ptm <- proc.time()
sim_results <- JointXshift(
  w = w,
  a = a,
  y = y,
  delta = deltas,
  n_folds = 3,
  num_cores = 6,
  outcome_type = "continuous",
  seed = seed)

proc.time() - ptm

## marginal effects
additive_results <- sim_results$`Additive Effects`
joint_results <- sim_results$`Joint Effects`
joint_vs_additive <- sim_results$`Joint vs Additive Effects`

```


The expected outcome change under additive assumptions is: 
```{r additive results}
additive_results
```


The expected outcome change under a joint shift is: 
```{r joint results}
joint_results
```

The difference is: 
```{r joint vs additive}
joint_vs_additive
```

This indicates that, compared to additive, the expected outcome change is -47.7, indicating possible more antagonistic relationships in the mixed exposure compared to synergistic.
